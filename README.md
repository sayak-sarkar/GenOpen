 GenOpen | Youth in Open Source:
=================================

 About the Project: 
====================
GenOpen is a single collaborative Open Source Webmaker Project where youth/kids (Generation Open!) are the project creators and contributors. Made Possible through Global Mozparties(any Webmaking event big or small), GenOpen is the first Open Source project run completely by youth. Mentors help guide youth and teach them about open source contribution, but it's the youth that define the how and what will be created.
